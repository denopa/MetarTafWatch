An Apple watch weather app for pilots

This app does almost nothing on the iPhone, and is designed to be used stand-alone on the Apple Watch. It offers aviation weather at a glance, as a complication on the watch face, and for up to four user-selectable airports, including nearest.

The complication is refreshed in the background in a way which aims to have very up to date information but not drain the battery unecessarily.

Airport information is provided, including best runway for the present conditions.
